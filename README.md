# Address-Parsing

Indian addresses show up on several web pages.  If
phone number and email id follow right after the address, you may consider them as
part of the address. Note that there may be multiple addresses appearing in different
parts of the same web page.

Indian addresses are written in multiple ways. So, you cannot make strong assumptions on the address format. For example, addresses may appear in a single line or
across multiple lines. Addresses may not contain pincode. For evaluation, only websites containing at least one address in English will be chosen.

Using an automated program we want to extract all addresses present in a webpage.
